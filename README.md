# Getting Started with the Blazor Range Selector Component
[Blazor Range Selector](https://www.syncfusion.com/blazor-components/blazor-range-selector?utm_source=github&utm_medium=listing&utm_campaign=blazor-range-selector-github-samples) is an interface for selecting a small range from a larger collection.A quick-start project that helps you get up and running with the Syncfusion Range Selector component in a Blazor WebAssembly application. This project contains the code to bind data; set ranges, series types, and a tooltip; customize grid and tick lines. You can also find the code to render a lightweight range selector without a chart.

## Project prerequisites
Make sure that you have the compatible versions of [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/ ) and [.NET Core SDK 6.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0) or later version in your machine before starting to work on this project.

## How to run this application
To run this application, you need to first clone the `getting-started-with-blazor-range-selector-component` repository and then open it in Visual Studio 2019. Now, simply build and run your project to view the output.

## Features and benefits
## Data Types
Plot any type of data in a Blazor Range Selector using different value types like numeric, date-time, and logarithmic.

## Chart Types
Plot the data in the Blazor Range Selector with different chart types like line, area and step line.

## Lightweight
Skip the chart and show the range alone to select data. This makes the range selector light weight in mobile devices.

## Scales
The major and minor scales display the range with different intervals and are placed at multiple levels of the range selector. The required date-time scale can be configured to be shown in major and minor scales.
 
## Period Selector
Select data using predefined periods in the range navigator and also use the date picker to select the custom range.

## Binding selected data
Bind selected data from the range selector to any other data visualization control using built-in events.

## Deferred scrolling

Allows you to defer the selected range to be updated until the user stops dragging the thumbs. This provides a smooth scrolling experience.

## Range selection
The Blazor Range Selector component provides the following three ways to select a range:

* Select a range through labels.
* Drag the left and right thumbs.
* Drag the selected range to maintain the same delta.

### Labels
Customize the size, color, font family, font attribute, and alignment of the labels using built-in APIs.

### Thumb
Customize the entire appearance of the left and right thumbs using built-in APIs.

### Gridlines

Customize the color, stroke width, dash array, and visibility of the major and minor using built-in APIs.

## Tooltip
Tooltips display the start and end values of a selected range to enable users to select a required range easily.

## Globalization and localization 

### Globalization

The Blazor Range Selector allows users from different locales to format dates, currency, and numbering to suit preferences. The Blazor Range Selector uses the Essential JS 2 internalization library for handling value formatting.

### Right to left {RTL}

The Blazor Range Selector supports right-to-left rendering, allowing the series and scale direction to be displayed from the right to left. This improves the user experience and accessibility of RTL languages.
